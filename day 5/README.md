##Task 1
KMEANS CLUSTERING
  I'have learned clearly how kmeans algorithm works
  It was challenging to code
##Task 2
CENTROID SELECTION IN KMEANS
  I'have learned centroid selection from distance and by features
##Task 3
STANDARDIZATION
  I'have learned to standardize the data by using preprocessing
##Task 4
ELBOW METHOD
  I'have learned how to find orginal no of clusters by elbow method
##Task 5
CLUSTER ANALYSIS
  By using this code we can find the capabilities of the clusters and it is tough to understand
##Task 6
PCA
  Principal component analysis is used to dimensionality reduction using the PCA module
  Challenging task
