# Ooops in Tasks â€“ Student Review

## Task 1: Class  
**What I Learned:**  
Learned how to define a class and create objects.
Understood how classes serve as blueprints for objects.
Gained experience using instance variables and methods.
**Difficulties Faced:**  
Initially struggled with understanding the difference between instance and class variables.
Faced issues while using self correctly inside methods. 

**Difficulty Level:** Easy  

---

## Task 2: Constructor 
Learned that a constructor is a special method used to initialize objects.
Understood how self is used to reference instance attributes.
Explored different types of constructors (default, parameterized).

**Difficulties Faced:**  
Had trouble with passing arguments correctly while creating objects.
Confused between instance variables and local variables inside the constructor.  

**Difficulty Level:** Moderate  

---

## Task 3: Inheritance 
**What I Learned:**  
Understood how one class can inherit attributes and methods from another.
Learned the concept of code reusability.
Explored super() to call parent class methods.
**Difficulties Faced:**  
Faced difficulty in understanding method overriding and when to use super().
Initially confused about how inherited attributes are accessed in child classes.

**Difficulty Level:** moderate

---

## Task 4:Multiple inheritance 
**What I Learned:**  
Learned that a class can inherit from more than one parent class.
Understood how method resolution order (MRO) works to avoid conflicts.

**Difficulties Faced:**  
Struggled with method resolution order (MRO) and how Python resolves conflicts between parent classes.
Faced difficulty when two parent classes had methods with the same name. 

**Difficulty Level:** challenging

---

## Task 5: Encapsulation
**What I Learned:**  
Understood how access modifiers (public, _protected, __private) work in Python.
Learned to use getter and setter methods to control access to private attributes.
**Difficulties Faced:**  
Initially misunderstood the difference between _protected and __private.
Had trouble implementing getter and setter methods.

**Difficulty Level:** Very Difficult  

---

## Task 6: Polymorphism  
**What I Learned:**  
Learned that polymorphism allows the same method to have different behaviors.
Explored method overriding in inheritance.
Understood the importance of duck typing in Python.
**Difficulties Faced:**  
Confused between method overloading and method overriding (since Python does not support traditional method overloading like other languages).
Initially struggled with dynamic method resolution in polymorphism.

**Difficulty Level:** easy
