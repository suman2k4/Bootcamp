## Task 1: Data Science Applications Brainstorm

### What I Learned:
- I explored real-world applications of data science beyond the ones mentioned in the learning materials.
- I learned how different industries like healthcare, retail, and agriculture use data science to improve efficiency.

### Difficulties Faced:
- Finding unique applications that were not already covered was challenging.
- Understanding how data science is specifically applied in each field required additional research.

### Final Thought:
This task helped me think beyond textbook examples and explore real-world use cases.

## Task 2: AI, ML, DL Relationship Diagram

### What I Learned:
- I understood the hierarchical relationship between AI, ML, and DL.
- Creating a diagram made it easier to see how Machine Learning is a subset of AI and Deep Learning is a subset of ML.

### Difficulties Faced:
- Designing a neat and clear diagram was difficult.
- Simplifying the explanation without making it too basic was a challenge.

### Final Thought:
Visualizing concepts helped me understand them better, and I will try to use diagrams more in my studies.

## Task 3: Data Scientist Roles Research

### What I Learned:
- A Data Scientist has multiple responsibilities, including data preprocessing, model building, and business communication.
- Not all data science roles require deep coding knowledge; some focus more on analysis and insights.

### Difficulties Faced:
- Differentiating between similar roles like Data Scientist and Data Engineer was confusing.
- Writing concise yet informative descriptions was a challenge.

### Final Thought:
Data Science involves more than just coding; business understanding and communication are equally important.

## Task 4: Data Science Lifecycle Example

### What I Learned:
- Data Science follows a structured process from problem definition to model deployment.
- Every step, from data collection to evaluation, is important for building an effective model.

### Difficulties Faced:
- Applying the lifecycle to a real-world scenario was tough since I had to break down each step.
- I found it difficult to differentiate between steps like data preprocessing and feature engineering.
